## Puppet webhook proxy

## What is this
This is an AWS Chalice app that will let github send webhook requests
to an Enterprise Puppetmaster running Code-Manager (such as an AWS
OpsWorks puppetmaster) and hosted in a private subnet


## Files

  - app.py   Chalice app file
  - install.sh  shell script to copy files about FYI
  - policy-dev.json  AWS policies to set permissions.  Set your account #
  - requirements.txt  required external python modules

## How it works

The chalice app is exposed via AWS API Gateway to the Internet.
A github repository is set up to send a webhook to the address of the 
API Gateway.   API Gateway passes the request to a Lambda function 
written in python

The Lambda function app checks that the HMAC SHA1 signatures from
github are correct and then forwards the request to the Puppetmaster.
This triggers a git pull on the Puppetmaster.  The git pull fetches
the latest files from the github repository that originated the request

The Puppetmaster is configured to use a private subnet but the external 
requests reach it via the API Gateway/ Lambda

If you don't want this extra complication then run the Puppetmaster in a public
subnet.  But your Puppetmaster will be externally exposed and the HMAC checking will not be in place

## Prerequisites

There is some set up of the Puppetmaster.  It must be configured to know where
to pull its configuration from on github, and it must have a ssh key that the
github repository knows.  With AWS Opsworks this is part of the setup

After this setup, login to the new Puppetmaster and use "puppet-access login" to make a token as detailed here https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2017.3/code_management/code_mgr_config.html#configuring-code-manager

Next, setup the Chalice part with the install.sh.  This should work on
a vanilla Centos 7 server.  It will give a URL

Then setup github.  Use the settings / webhook page from the project.  
The payload URL is the chalice URL with the extra path "/hooky" on the end

## Set the secrets and url

Go into the AWS SSM Parameter store (it's part of the EC2 stuff on the
AWS web Console)

You should now have
 - the puppet-access "token"
 - the shared secret from github setting page
 - the url of the puppetmaster

Set up the secret as /nonprod/puppet/sharedkey, the token generated by 
"puppet-access login" as /nonprod/puppet/token and the url of the puppetmaster as /nonprod/puppet/url

Then try a commit and push.  The changes should pop up on the Puppetmaster

## notes on the code

The most difficult part was getting the HMAC signature correct

All the code examples I could find for this were in Ruby.  But the tool I
was using for the API Gateway/Lambda integration used Python.  The key
insights were that

1) the header is called X-Hub-Signature

2) the raw body is in the correct format for the Python 3.6 HMAC library.  The shared key has to be converted to bytes

3) the code for calculating the HMAC signature is
        ps = hmac.new(sharedkey,
                      app.current_request.raw_body,
                      'sha1').hexdigest()

4) github webhooks have a 10 second time out.  With our server config
this isn't enough (usually it was 13 seconds).  By setting the "wait"
part of the request from the Lambda to the Puppetmaster to be false the
request returns immediately, I assume it is asynchronous

There is debug logging in many places but by default the lines to set this
up are commented out

If you wish to alter the ssm parameter store paths then modify the policy
as well as the get_parameter calls in the code
